# Documentation for Implementation of a Classical Arithmetic Function on the IBM Quantum Computer: Division
This is a documentation explanation of how to employ an IBM Quantum Computer to carry out a division operation using classical arithmetic.
## Title: Division Implementation on an IBM Quantum Computer

We will examine how to implement division on an IBM Quantum Computer utilizing quantum computing techniques in this documentation. In contrast to traditional bits, which can only be either 0 or 1, quantum computing uses quantum bits, also known as qubits, to conduct computations. With some restrictions, the fundamental arithmetic operation of division can also be used in the quantum world.
