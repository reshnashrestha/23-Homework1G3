# Documentation for Implementation of a Classical Arithmetic Function on the IBM Quantum Computer: Division
This is a documentation explanation of how to employ an IBM Quantum Computer to carry out a division operation using classical arithmetic.

## Title: Division Implementation on an IBM Quantum Computer
We will examine how to implement division on an IBM Quantum Computer utilizing quantum computing techniques in this documentation. In contrast to traditional bits, which can only be either 0 or 1, quantum computing uses quantum bits, also known as qubits, to conduct computations. With some restrictions, the fundamental arithmetic operation of division can also be used in the quantum world. Quantum computing is arduous and fun at a time. Let's do this. 

### Prerequisites:
It is always good to have familiarity with quantum gates, qubits, and the IBM Quantum Experience platform before we start learning about quantum division.

### Division Implementation Steps:
#### 1. Initialization:
Initialize the quantum circuit with the required qubits first. Two qubits are required for the dividend and the divisor in the division scenario, as well as additional qubits for auxiliary operations.
#### 2. Encode Inputs:
We need to encode the dividend and divisor as quantum states using quantum gates. We can use gates like the Pauli-X gate or the Hadamard gate to prepare the required qubits in the desired initial states.
#### 3. Apply quantum Subtraction:
Quantum subtraction, which is effectively the opposite of addition, is a component of quantum division. To achieve subtraction, we have to employ quantum gates like the Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate and Controlled-Z gate. To sustain the quantum superposition, this stage calls for precise qubit manipulation.
#### 4.Algorithm for Quantum Division:
We should use the quantum division algorithm, which will differ based on the particular issue we are trying to solve. We can utilize quantum versions of classical algorithms like long division for simple integer division in this case.
#### 5. Measurement and processing afterward:
We should check for our qubits' final quantum states. We tried to receive the outcome of the quantum division as classical bits from these observations. It might be necessary to perform further post-processing to properly interpret the results of division.
