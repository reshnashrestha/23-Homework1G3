# Documentation for Implementation of a Classical Arithmetic Function on the IBM Quantum Computer: Division
This is a documentation explanation of how to employ an IBM Quantum Computer to carry out a division operation using classical arithmetic.

## Title: Division Implementation on an IBM Quantum Computer
We will examine how to implement division on an IBM Quantum Computer utilizing quantum computing techniques in this documentation. In contrast to traditional bits, which can only be either 0 or 1, quantum computing uses quantum bits, also known as qubits, to conduct computations. With some restrictions, the fundamental arithmetic operation of division can also be used in the quantum world. Quantum computing is arduous and fun at a time. Let's do this. 

### Prerequisites:
It is always good to have familiarity with quantum gates, qubits, and the IBM Quantum Experience platform before we start learning about quantum division.

### Division Implementation Steps:
#### 1. Initialization:
Initialize the quantum circuit with the required qubits first. Two qubits are required for the dividend and the divisor in the division scenario, as well as additional qubits for auxiliary operations.
#### 2. Encode Inputs:
We need to encode the dividend and divisor as quantum states using quantum gates. We can use gates like the Pauli-X gate or the Hadamard gate to prepare the required qubits in the desired initial states.
#### 3. Apply quantum Subtraction:
Quantum subtraction, which is effectively the opposite of addition, is a component of quantum division. To achieve subtraction, we have to employ quantum gates like the Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate and Controlled-Z gate. To sustain the quantum superposition, this stage calls for precise qubit manipulation.
#### 4.Algorithm for Quantum Division:
We should use the quantum division algorithm, which will differ based on the particular issue we are trying to solve. We can utilize quantum versions of classical algorithms like long division for simple integer division in this case.
#### 5. Measurement and processing afterward:
We should check for our qubits' final quantum states. We tried to receive the outcome of the quantum division as classical bits from these observations. It might be necessary to perform further post-processing to properly interpret the results of division.

##### Fristly, we considered a simple example for classical division to construct quantum circuit for simple quantum division of classical function, say 10 divided by 5.
To construct a quantum circuit for simple quantum division of the classical function f(x)=x/5, we can use the following steps:

- Encode the classical function into a quantum state: This can be done by using three qubits to represent the input value (10) and the divisor (5), and then applying a Hadamard gate to each qubit. This will put the qubits into a superposition of all possible input values.
- Implement the division operation: This can be done using a variety of different quantum gates, depending on the specific function being divided. For example, to divide by 5, we could use a controlled-NOT gate to swap the state of two qubits if the first qubit is in the state ∣1⟩ and the second qubit is in the state ∣0⟩.
- Measure the qubits: Once the division operation has been applied, we can measure the qubits to obtain the result of the division.
Here is an example of a quantum circuit for simple quantum division of the classical function f(x)=x/5:

``` python

import qiskit

# Create a quantum circuit with three qubits
qc = qiskit.QuantumCircuit(3)

# Encode the classical function into a quantum state
qc.h(0)
qc.h(1)
qc.h(2)

# Implement the division operation
qc.cx(1, 2)
qc.cx(0, 2)

# Measure the qubits
qc.measure([2, 1, 0], [2, 1, 0])

# Draw the circuit
qc.draw('mpl')
```

There is a 20% chance that this circuit will yield the right division result. We can run the circuit again and average the results to increase accuracy.

**To construct the quantum circuit for dividing 10 by 5 in IBM Quantum Composer:**

1. Go to IBM Quantum Composer and create a new circuit.
2. Add three qubits to the circuit.
3. Apply a Hadamard gate to each qubit.
4. Apply a controlled-NOT gate to the second and third qubits, with the second qubit as the control qubit and the third qubit as the target qubit.
5. Apply a controlled-NOT gate to the first and third qubits, with the first qubit as the control qubit and the third qubit as the target qubit.
6. Measure the third qubit.

##### For this particular case we got following restrictions:
* **Limited number of qubits:** IBM quantum computers currently have a maximum of 127 qubits, which may limit the size and complexity of the division circuits that can be run.
* **Qubit quality:** IBM quantum computers have qubits that are not perfect, and there is a chance of errors occurring during the execution of a circuit. This can reduce the accuracy of the division results.
* **Noise level:** IBM quantum computers can be noisy, which can also affect the accuracy of the division results.

To mitigate these limitations, it is necessary to repeat the division circuit multiple times and average the results. This can help to improve the accuracy of the results, but it can also increase the time and resources required to perform the division operation.

Despite these limitations, IBM quantum computers have the potential to be used for division tasks in the future. As quantum computing technology continues to develop, we can expect to see IBM quantum computers with more qubits, better qubit quality, and lower noise levels. This will make them more suitable for a wider range of division tasks.

**Limitations of Quantum Computers for Division**

The limitations of using a quantum computer for division, as demonstrated in this example, are numerous:

* **Inefficiency:** Quantum computers are not optimized for basic arithmetic operations. The approach used in this example is highly inefficient compared to classical division algorithms.
* **Quantum Overhead:** Quantum operations come with an overhead that makes them impractical for basic arithmetic. The quantum circuit used here is much more complex than classical division.
* **Limited Precision:** Quantum computers operate with qubits that can represent superpositions of states, which makes them unsuitable for exact, high-precision arithmetic.
* **Error Handling:** Quantum computers are susceptible to errors due to noise and decoherence. Handling errors in quantum division would be challenging and resource-intensive.

Despite these limitations, quantum computers could potentially be used for division in the future, especially if they are optimized for basic arithmetic operations and if error handling techniques are improved. However, for now, classical division algorithms are much more efficient and practical for most applications.
