For the process of performing operation like division in quantam computer there are various steps;
1. ## Encoding Input:
To convert the numbers I want to divide to quantam states. Quantam bits can represent binary numbers, so I need to encode the numbers in quantam registers.


2. ## Implement division algorithm:
For this task we need to develop a quantam algorithm that use quantam gates to manipulate qubits and perform division operation.

3. ## Quantam Superposition:
This part is used to perform multiple division operations at once.

4. ## Quantam Entanglement:
To keep corelation among the qubits to aid quantam division.

5. ## Measurement:
We need to measure the quantam state to extract the result of measurement. Since the result of quantam states are probabilitic we need to perfom the division algorithm
multiple times to get significant result.

6. ## Error Correction:
To prevent the possible errors due to environmental factors, we need to apply error correcting algorithm inorder to get reliable result.

7. ## Quantam Hardware:
It is essential to have quantam programming framework like qiskit, cirq or other quantam development tools to perform quantam operations. Since quantam computer have limited qubits count and coherence time. This is the possible reason why implementing division function is challenging.
   ## Post Processing:
   Depending on the quantam Computer's output we need to post process result to obtain meaningful division result.
