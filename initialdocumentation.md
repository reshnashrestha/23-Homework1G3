# Steps to access quantum computer services on local machine:

### 1 Learn the Basics of Quantum Computing: 
It's important to have a fundamental understanding of quantum computing concepts before using any quantum computer services. In contrast to classical computers, quantum computers operate differently and substitute qubits for bits.

### 2 Select a Quantum Computing Platform: 
There are a number of platforms for quantum computing, including IBM Quantum, Google Quantum, and Microsoft Quantum. We will be using IBM Quantum Platform for this task.

### 3 Install Required Software: 
To run quantum programs on our local PC, the majority of quantum computing platforms offer software development kits (SDKs) and simulators. These SDKs, which frequently include Python libraries for quantum programming, must be installed.

### 4 Account Set up:
Create an account on the website for the quantum computing platform by registering there. We will be able to use this account to access our quantum computers and services.

### 5 Generate API Key or Token:
Platforms for quantum computing often offer API keys or tokens that let us securely access their services. These keys must be generated using the account dashboard.

### 6 Install additional tools and libraries for quantum development: 
We might need to install extra tools and libraries for quantum development. For instance, we can install Qiskit, a well-liked Python library for quantum programming, if we are using IBM Quantum.

### 7 Authenticate our Local Machine: 
We usually need to authenticate our local machine by supplying an application programming interface (API) password or token in order to access quantum computers remotely. By doing this action, the quantum hardware access is secured.
